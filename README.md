# SpecGUI

A user-friendly graphical interface for capturing, exploring, and analyzing spectral signatures from spectrometers.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kebincontreras/SpecGUI.git
   cd SpecGUI
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   - Simply double-click on `Run_project.bat`
   - The script will automatically:
     - Set up a Python virtual environment
     - Install all required dependencies
     - Launch the spectral analysis GUI

That's it! No manual setup required.

## Features

- **Spectral Data Acquisition:** Capture spectral signatures directly from connected spectrometers
- **Data Visualization:** Real-time plotting and analysis of spectral data
- **Sample Management:** Organize and compare different spectral samples (White, Black, and Sample references)
- **File Import/Export:** Load and save spectral data in MATLAB (.mat) and NumPy (.npz) formats
- **Automated Workflow:** One-click setup and execution for researchers

## System Requirements

- Windows operating system
- Python (any version) - automatically configured by the setup script
- USB connection for spectrometer devices (if using hardware acquisition)

## Usage

After launching the application:

1. Connect your spectrometer device (optional - you can also load existing data)
2. Use the interface to capture spectral samples for White reference, Black reference, and your samples
3. Visualize and analyze the spectral signatures in real-time
4. Save your results for further analysis
